# What's this

Just me learning rust through the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Should you care?

Probably not. I'm just doing this for fun, and since this is just for my future reference, I'm not going to be very good at explaining things.

## What's the point?

I'm not sure. I'm just doing this for fun, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it. I'm not sure if I'm going to make a game, or a web app, or a CLI app, or what. I'm just going to learn rust, and see where it takes me.

Btw, all of the text above was written by copilot, I don't have so much free time to explain all this lol.
